A backup set is made up of one *.4BK file, one *.4BR and 0 or more *.4BS files.

The 4BR files are backup resource files for a particular backup.

The 4BK file is the initial backup data file.

The 4BS file is a segment file for when a 4BK file overflows

The file name after the site prefix ends in a backup sequence number
and an optional dash and a segment number.
